#**Analysis**

*Each of us conducted our own EDA. We then went through and answered our research questions. 

#**Reseach Questions: 
1. Which days of the year were the most popular for bike sharing in 2011 and 2012?
2. Does the weather impact the number of bike share users?
3. Do registered users use the bike sharing program more on a working day or a day off?
4. Do casual users use the bike sharing program more on a working day or a day off?
5. Did the bike sharing program get more or less popular in 2012 compared to 2011?
