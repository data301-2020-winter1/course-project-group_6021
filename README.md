## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{The Bike Sharing dataset was provided by the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support (LIAAD) at the University of Porto. This dataset includes Capital Bikeshare System’s hourly and daily count of rental bike usage from 2011 to 2012. Additionally, the data consists of information on the season, year, month, holiday, weekday, working day, and corresponding weather and seasonal information. The purpose of our dataset is to understand how bike sharing systems can help monitor mobility in metropolitan areas. Additionally, by analyzing this data future researchers will have the ability to trace how many people are commuting in a more eco-friendly way. For example, this data provides an opportunity to track pollution increase or even decrease on a specific day. The dataset was collected through a two-year historical log corresponding during the years of 2011 and 2012. The data came from the Capital Bikeshare System in Washington, D.C, USA.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{With this project, we hope to understand what days of the year hold the most important events. We are interested in this topic because bike sharing systems, along with other environmentally friendly transportation options, are becoming increasingly popular. Additionally, bike sharing programs are unique in that they provide information on the duration of travel, departure position and arrival position. Thus, this data can provide insight into the trends of community transportation that other transportation options, such as using a bus, cannot. Using this data, we want to explore which days of the year are the busiest. Specifically, we want to know the days of the year that are the most popular for bike sharing and if these days correlate with a specific event or holiday. We imagine that we will be able to build a user-facing Dashboard with this dataset that will make it easier for those who do not know how to analyze data to understand trends of transportation.}
